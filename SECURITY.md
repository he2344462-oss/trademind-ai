# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

TradeMind is currently in an early open-source MVP stage. Security fixes are prioritized for the `main` branch and the latest public release when releases are available.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | Yes |
| Latest release | Yes |
| Older releases | Best effort |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub Issues.

If you discover a vulnerability, please contact the maintainer privately:

- GitHub: <https://github.com/lien0219>

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the issue.
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept.
- Affected version, commit, or deployment mode.
- Potential impact.
- Suggested mitigation if available.

Please do not include real API keys, platform tokens, cookies, passwords, or other secrets in the report.

## Security Scope

TradeMind handles sensitive operational data, including:

- AI API keys
- Storage access keys
- Platform app secrets
- Store access tokens and refresh tokens
- Webhook secrets
- Admin account credentials

These values must not be committed to the repository. Use `.env` locally, keep `.env` out of git, and configure runtime secrets securely in production.

## Disclosure Process

We aim to acknowledge security reports as soon as possible and coordinate fixes responsibly. Public disclosure should happen only after a fix or mitigation is available.

## Production Deployment Notes

Before exposing TradeMind to a public network, you should:

- Change `JWT_SECRET`, `APP_MASTER_KEY`, admin bootstrap password, and database passwords.
- Use HTTPS and a trusted reverse proxy.
- Restrict database and Redis access to private networks.
- Avoid logging secrets, tokens, cookies, or complete third-party API responses.
- Review platform OAuth callback URLs and permissions.
- Back up PostgreSQL data and uploaded files.

## P10 Credential and Read-only Boundary

P10 stores Provider credential values only in backend AES-256-GCM envelopes whose AAD binds tenant, platform, credential ID, and version. Admin/API DTOs expose metadata only. Local keys and offline OAuth are development/test-only and fail closed in staging/production; a managed key provider is still required before external activation.

OAuth state is random, expiring, single-use, and tenant/user/platform/shop/redirect bound. Redirects use an exact configured allowlist. The P10 Douyin adapter accepts only the trusted official HTTPS host, applies connection/request/header timeouts and a response-size limit, maps errors to safe internal codes, and exposes no inventory write capability.

Current P10 runtime remains `L0`: real platform network, real credentials, real inventory read/write, inventory mutation, Worker, automatic business retry, Gray, and Production Ready are all disabled. Five kill switches take precedence over feature flags, and the write kill switch is permanently active in this release.

## Market Signal Provider Credentials

Market Signal Provider configuration never accepts API keys, tokens, passwords, or secrets inside its ordinary JSON config. Provider rows store only an opaque `credential_reference`; the local implementation supports `env:VARIABLE_NAME`, and the runtime interface can be replaced by KMS or a managed secret store. Read APIs expose only `configured` and a masked suffix. Health-check errors are length-limited and redact resolved credential values. Official/authorized placeholder providers remain fail-closed until a lawful adapter and credential are explicitly configured.
